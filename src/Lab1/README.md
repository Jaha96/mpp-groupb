### 3.1 Problem Description:

A **Project Manager** manages **multiple projects**. A **project**, before **final release**, is
required to have a specified **feature set**. Associated with a **project** are **multiple
releases**. A **release** is a **functional piece** of the **project** being developed that
includes a **subset of the feature set** for the **project** and which is to be delivered on a
**specified date** (the **feature set** and **release date** are determined by the **Project
Manager**). When the **last release** is delivered, the **project** is considered completed.
Associated with each **feature** for a **project** is a **developer** who is responsible for
developing this **feature** for inclusion in the **project**. A **developer** has an **id** and
provides, for each **feature** he is responsible for, the **estimated time** **remaining to
complete work** on that **feature**. The **Project Manager** assigns **features** to **developers**
to work on.
