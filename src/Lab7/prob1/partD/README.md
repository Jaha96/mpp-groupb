This approach add a variable `visisted` to `Employee` class to keep track of whether the employee has been visited or not. 
This variable is then used in the `equals` and `hashCode` method to determine whether two employees are the same or not.

However, in the for loop of `main` method, the `visited` variable is not set to `true` for the original list. It is only set to `true` for the list of unique employees. Therefore, the `equals` method will always return false and the `hashCode` method will always return different hash code for the same employee.
